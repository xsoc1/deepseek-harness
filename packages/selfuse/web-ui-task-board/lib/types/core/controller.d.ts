/**
 * Board controller: the single owner of task-ledger state and view state.
 *
 * In production it projects the Host ledger and submits confirmed actions;
 * the legacy store/execution seams remain for v1 migration tests. It also
 * closes the board whenever the user navigates to a session.
 * Framework-free (structural runtime faces) so the whole orchestration is
 * unit-testable with fakes.
 *
 * The per use-case domain transitions (create/update/delete/schedule) live in
 * dedicated modules under core/use-cases and are applied here; the controller
 * owns only the orchestration seam (state, persistence, notify, execution,
 * navigation, reconciliation).
