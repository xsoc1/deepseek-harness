/**
 * The remote desktop data channel: `/remote` is this plugin's own prefix, so
 * the paired-device cookie is the access control (exactly like `/m/api`).
 * After that gate, every fenced same-origin path the browser rewrote here is
 * re-issued to 127.0.0.1 as a loopback-shaped request so sibling plugin
 * fences (and the connection plugin's `/api`) accept it — no `--trusted-host`
 * and no per-plugin pairing consult.
 *
 * Security model:
 * - Every request must carry a live paired-device cookie, enforced before
 *   any bytes are forwarded and before any host call.
 * - The SDK's loopback-only privileged methods (native dialogs, the settings
 *   plane, credentials — the `PRIVILEGED_METHODS` set of client-connection)
 *   are denied here. The set is pinned by tests/remote-contract.spec.ts.
 * - `/api/pair/*`, `/api/update/*`, `/api/plugin-manager/*`,
 *   `/api/dsh-desktop-launcher/*` and `/api/dsh-web-ui-settings/*` stay physically local.
 * - Everything else is HTTP- or WebSocket-proxied to the local port with
 *   Host rewritten, Origin and cookies dropped, and a synthetic same-origin
 *   browser marker added after authentication. Plugin loopback fences then
 *   pass. The pairing cookie never leaves this process.
