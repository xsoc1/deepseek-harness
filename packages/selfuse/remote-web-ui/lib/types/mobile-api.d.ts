/**
 * The mobile surface's data channel: `/m/api` proxies the host ApiProxy
 * service for the standalone phone page. The phone's RPC calls ride THIS
 * prefix instead of the connection plugin's `/api` — so the tunneled Host
 * never needs to enter the connection trust fence (a distributable plugin
 * cannot change that fence), and this plugin's own pairing gate is the
 * access control instead.
 *
 * Security model:
 * - Every request must carry a live paired-device cookie (the same gate
 *   semantic as the LAN fence), enforced before any host call.
 * - Only an explicit allowlist of methods is proxied; privileged domains
 *   (settings, credentials, host actions, goals, subagents, …) are never
 *   reachable from the phone.
 * - `session.list` is paged here (the host API returns everything; this
 *   layer slices stable pages) so the phone never transfers the whole list.
 * - The live mux stream is bridged over Server-Sent Events on the same
 *   prefix (one-directional push; answers to questions/approvals ride the
 *   unary channel), gated identically.
