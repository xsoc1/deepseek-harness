/**
 * Mobile-surface live-event client: the plugin's `/m/api/events.mux` SSE
 * channel (Server-Sent Events — the host bridges the mux stream onto it, so
 * no WebSocket handshake or framing is needed on this side). The host
 * pushes mux frames (subscribed baselines, session events, approvals,
 * questions, queue snapshots, tasks, projections) as soon as the stream
 * opens — no subscription handshake is needed. Frames arrive as
 * server-request envelopes whose payload is the mux frame; unknown frame
 * types are dropped so a newer host never breaks this client.
 *
 * EventSource reconnects automatically — but only over a tunnel that
 * actually forwards frames. Public quick tunnels (Cloudflare quick tunnel /
 * Tailscale Serve) do not transparently pass Server-Sent Events: ordinary
 * HTTP works, yet the SSE connection stays open or reconnects with zero
 * bytes, so no live frame ever arrives. That is a transport-layer limit of
 * the tunnel, not something the host can fix. This client therefore
 * degrades gracefully: once the SSE channel has silently stalled (no frame
 * for {@link MuxClientOptions.stallThresholdMs}, or the EventSource reports
 * an error), it starts polling the open session's history over plain HTTP
 * (the `/m/api/session.history` RPC — unaffected by the SSE limitation),
 * and re-emits freshly appended events as `session/event` frames through
 * the same subscriber contract, so listeners (and the message fold) behave
 * exactly as if the frames had arrived over SSE. When the SSE channel
 * delivers again, fallback polling stops and the live stream takes over.
