/**
 * Sessions level: one workspace's sessions, loaded incrementally — the
 * first page fetches session.list with a cursor, scrolling appends further
 * pages (never the whole list at once). Rows are filtered to the opened
 * workspace by its owned session ids; extra pages are pulled on demand so
 * a workspace with many sessions converges without a full transfer.
 *
 * Creating a session is this level's other action: the workspace's id is
 * sent to session.create (the host attaches the new session to it), the
 * fresh row is prepended optimistically, and the user lands straight in
 * the new chat — the same "new session opens" flow as the desktop UI.
