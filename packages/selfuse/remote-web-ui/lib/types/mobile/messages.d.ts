/**
 * Message fold: collapse a session event stream into a renderable, ordered
 * message list for the mobile surface.
 *
 * The mobile page is an independent, self-contained bundle, so this module has
 * no value imports: it re-declares a local `WireEvent` (a loose envelope with a
 * typed `type` and a wide `data`) and folds it into {@link RenderMessage} rows.
 * It is a pure, side-effect-free fold — callers hold the rendered list and feed
 * the next batch of events in to get the next list. Caller-supplied `existing`
 * messages are never mutated: every change builds a fresh message object.
 *
 * The data shapes follow the host session protocol (see the dsh session
 * `types.ts` / `surface.ts` and the llm `types.ts` sources the reference audit
 * read):
 *
 * - `user/message`      data = `{ id, role, content: ContentBlock[], source }`
 * - `assistant/message` data = `{ turn, step, message: { id, content }, usage? }`
 * - `assistant/chunk`   data = `{ turn, step, chunk: { type: 'text-delta' | 'reasoning-delta', text } }`
 * - `turn/start`        data = `{ turn }`
 * - `turn/end`          data = `{ turn, reason: { kind: 'error' | ... } }`
 * - `tool/call`         data = `{ turn, step, callId, name, arguments }`
 * - `session/end-seed`  empty data (skipped)
 *
 * Assistant content blocks (`text` vs `reasoning`) fold into two separate
 * fields — `text` and `reasoning` — so the surface can show reasoning behind
 * a collapsed disclosure instead of dumping it into the message body. Tool
 * calls accumulate ordered details (`tools`) in addition to the plain
 * `toolSummary` name list.
 *
 * The mobile message-level aliases `message/chunk`, `message/update` and
 * `message/delete` are also accepted (assumed shapes documented below).
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - Events are applied in ascending `seq` order.
 * - A `seq` watermark is derived from `existing` (the max already-rendered
 *   message seq). Events whose seq is already at or below the watermark are
 *   skipped, which makes re-applying the same batch idempotent without
 *   double-folding streamed chunk text.
 * - Create events additionally dedupe by message id, so a repeated
 *   `user/message` / `assistant/message` replaces in place instead of duplicating.
 * - A pending assistant message (alive while `assistant/chunk`-style deltas
 *   keep arriving, `pending: true`) is finalized by the matching
 *   `assistant/message` (same id or `(turn, step)`) or closed by `turn/end`.
