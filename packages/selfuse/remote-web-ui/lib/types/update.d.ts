 * captured pnpm output) when nothing moved, so the panel can tell the user
 * how to unblock the gate instead of claiming success.
 *

 * latest stays 0.1.15 — that is a real update, not stale. The post-run anchor
 * path is re-resolved rather than reused from boot time: pnpm removes the old
 * version's .pnpm directory on update, so a boot-time captured path would
 * fail to read and collapse a successful update into a bogus 'missing'.
 *
 * A green exit whose verification has nothing to compare (registry probe
 * outage, missing anchor, non-npm mode) is reported as `verify-failed` — it
 * must never read as success. A green exit where no package moved but the
 * post-run check could not prove the install is fully current (a partial
 * probe failure hides whether a gate kept something back) is also
 * `verify-failed`: it must not collapse into a success either.
 * @param deps - the run and check seams.
