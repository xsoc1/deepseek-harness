/**
 * Pairing state machine: one active one-time token, a device-session table,
 * and presence tracking. Pure TypeScript with injected clock/randomness so
 * the whole security semantics are unit-testable without cordis. The
 * cordis-facing surfaces (routes, the api/gate listener) live next door.
 *
 * Security invariants:
 * - One active token at a time; `issue()` replaces it, so a refreshed QR
 *   immediately invalidates the previous link.
 * - A token is consumed by the first successful `accept()` — reuse is
 *   refused with `'used'`.
 * - Tokens expire; `accept()` on an expired token is refused like an
 *   unknown one (no oracle for validity).
 * - `stop()` revokes every device session and clears the token, so paired
 *   devices are cut off on their next gated request.
 * - `revoke()` drops one device session; idle sessions older than
 *   `idleExpireMs` are deleted on sweep, load, and the next gated request.
