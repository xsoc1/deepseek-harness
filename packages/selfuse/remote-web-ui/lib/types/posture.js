 * actually refuses non-loopback requests for every origin this deployment
 * advertises (the public tunnel host, the LAN bases). The fence is the SDK's
 * own Host check — the one seam a plugin cannot mount a gate into — so this
 * probe is the guardrail that makes a re-opened `/api` (for example a
 * re-added `--trusted-host`, or the SDK's LAN-literal auto-trust under
 * `--host 0.0.0.0`) visible instead of silent.
 *
 * The probe issues loopback requests with a forged Host header — the exact
 * shape a tunnel or LAN client produces — and treats anything other than a
 * 403 as exposed: the fence is documented to refuse with 403, so any other
 * status means the request reached the RPC bridge.
