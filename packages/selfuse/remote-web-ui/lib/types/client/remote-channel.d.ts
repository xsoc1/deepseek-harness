/**
 * The remote desktop channel — browser half. On a non-loopback origin (LAN
 * address or public tunnel) fenced host routes refuse the request, and
 * pairing is the real access control — so same-origin traffic the desktop
 * issues is rewritten onto this plugin's gated `/remote` prefix (host half
 * in src/remote-api.ts). The host then re-issues the call to 127.0.0.1 so
 * plugin loopback fences pass.
 *
 * The rewrite is deliberately narrow:
 * - loopback origins are untouched (the desktop at 127.0.0.1 keeps original paths);
 * - the pairing routes (`/api/pair/*`) stay where they are — accept must
 *   work BEFORE a device is paired;
 * - the update endpoints (`/api/update/*`) stay loopback-only;
 * - desktop-launcher create/shutdown (`/api/dsh-desktop-launcher/*`) stay
 *   loopback-only (host-local files and process exit);
 * - the family settings bridge (`/api/dsh-web-ui-settings/*`) stays
 *   loopback-only (same plane as SDK settings.*);
 * - `/api/*` (SDK methods and `/api/<plugin>/...` plugin namespaces),
 *   `/sidebar/*`, `/git/*`, and `/pet/*` ride the channel;
 * - fetch, EventSource, WebSocket, and img/script/iframe `src` are patched;
 *   everything else calls the original unchanged.
 *
 * Pure helpers are exported for unit tests; `installRemoteChannel` patches
 * the given window and returns their restore.
